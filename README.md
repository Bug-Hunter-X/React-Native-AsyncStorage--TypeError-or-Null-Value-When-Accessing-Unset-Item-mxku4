# React Native AsyncStorage: Handling Asynchronous Operations and Null Values

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with AsyncStorage in React Native applications. The problem arises from attempting to access a value from AsyncStorage before the asynchronous operation has finished, leading to `TypeError` or unexpected `null` values.

## Problem

The main issue is that AsyncStorage operations are asynchronous.  If you try to access the result of `AsyncStorage.getItem` before the promise resolves, the value will be undefined or null, potentially causing errors in your application.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly handling the asynchronous nature of `AsyncStorage.getItem` using promises and properly managing the state during the asynchronous operation.

This example demonstrates both the problem and its solution using the `useState` hook to manage state and `useEffect` to fetch the value from AsyncStorage.
